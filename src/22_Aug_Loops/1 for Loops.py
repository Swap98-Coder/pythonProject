# Python has 2 loops

# Print hello word 10 time

# for loop
# Syntax: Structure
# for variable name in the range of (Start, Stop, Step):

# Range (Start, Stop, Step)
# Range (0, 10. 1)
# Range (0, 10)
# Range ( 10 ) # by default start will be taken as 0
# by default it will take difference between start no. and next no. is 1

# Range is in-built class and function and Utility.

for i in range(1,10):  # output = 1 to 9 # i = variable name
    print (i)  # why new line = by default end of the line is end="\n"

print("\n")

for j in range(3, 5):  # output = 3 and 4
    print(j)

print("\n")

for l in range(1, 10, 2): # output = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 0
    print(l)

print("\n")

for i in range(1, 11): # output = hello -> 1 to 10
    print("hello ->", i)

print("\n")

for number in range(10, 0, -2): # output = 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
    print(number)

print("\n")

for test in range(0, 10, -2): # output = nothing will be going to print
    print(test)

 print("\n")
