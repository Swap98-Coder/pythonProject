# While loop

# Syntax:

#variable_name = 0
#while condition:
    #execute this code
    #variable_name increment

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i, end = "") # output = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    i = i + 1

# logic
# i = 10 , 10 < 10 -> Out of the loop

#we don't have increment operator i++ or i-- in case of python
